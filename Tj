Real-time scenario-based AWS EC2 Interview Questions & Answers:
This will cover all aspects: EC2 basics, instances, storage, networking, security, auto-scaling, monitoring, cost optimization, high availability, DevOps, troubleshooting, and real-world scenarios.
1 Q: What is Amazon EC2? 
A: EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to launch virtual servers with different instance types, operating systems, and configurations.
2 Q: Scenario: You need a virtual server to host a web application for 1 year. Which EC2 pricing model is cost-efficient? 
A: Reserved Instances for 1-year term to save costs compared to on-demand.
3 Q: Difference between EC2 and Lambda? 
A: EC2 = full server control, long-running workloads. Lambda = serverless, short-duration functions with no server management.
4.Q: Scenario: You want ephemeral compute for batch jobs. Which instance type? 
A: Spot Instances for cost savings.
5.Q: What are EC2 instance types? 
A: General Purpose (t3/t4), Compute Optimized (c5), Memory Optimized (r5), Storage Optimized (i3), GPU Instances (p4/g4), etc.
6.Q: Scenario: Your app needs 4 vCPUs and 16GB RAM. Which instance type class? A: General Purpose (e.g., t3.xlarge) or Compute Optimized if CPU-bound.
7.Q: Difference between on-demand, reserved, spot, and savings plan? A: On-demand = pay per hour, no commitment. Reserved = 1–3 year commitment, cheaper. Spot = spare capacity at discount, can be interrupted. Savings plan = flexible discounted pricing for compute usage.
8.Q: Scenario: You need instances for dev/test environment that can stop/start frequently. Which pricing model? A: On-demand for flexibility or spot if interruptions are acceptable.
9.Q: What is an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)? A: A pre-configured template containing OS, application server, and apps to launch EC2 instances.
