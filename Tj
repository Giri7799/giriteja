As per the October roster, my designated week off was originally scheduled for 1st November. However, due to a change in the weekly off pattern, 1st November was marked as a working day, and I have accordingly reported to work on that day. In light of this adjustment, I would like to request a compensatory week off on 20th November 2025. Kindly let me know if this can be accommodated.
